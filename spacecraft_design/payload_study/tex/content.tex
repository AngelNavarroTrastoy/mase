\begin{abstract}
The study of Earth atmosphere and its dynamic is a very interesting topic for
wheather accurate forecasting. Even nowadays, with improven numerical methods
and complex atmospheric models, we are not able to determine an accurate wheather
prediction if the conditions are extremes or the predition times increases.\\

The purpose of the \textbf{A}tmospheric \textbf{D}ynamics \textbf{M}ission Aeolus
is to further develop the knoldedge of Earth atmosphere and wheater models.
In this study is going to be analysed why the instrument developed for this
mission is the better solution for this purpose.\\

ADM-Aeolus is an Earth Observation satellite manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space
and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), that as launched on August 22, 2018
from the Guiana Space Centre, in Kourou (French Guiana).\\
