@article{Reitebuch,
abstract = {Abstract The global observation of profiles of the atmospheric wind speed is the highest-priority unmet need for global numerical weather prediction. Satellite Doppler lidar is the most promising candidate to meet the requirements on global wind profile observations with high vertical resolution, precision, and accuracy. The European Space Agency (ESA) decided to implement a Doppler wind lidar mission called the Atmospheric Dynamics Mission Aeolus (ADM-Aeolus) to demonstrate the potential of the Doppler lidar technology and the expected impact on numerical weather forecasting. An airborne prototype of the instrument on ADM-Aeolus was developed to validate the instrument concept and retrieval algorithms with realistic atmospheric observations before the satellite launch. It is the first airborne direct-detection Doppler lidar for atmospheric observations, and it is operating at an ultraviolet wavelength of 355 nm. The optical design is described in detail, including the single-frequency pulsed laser and th...},
